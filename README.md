# Snake

Here is another Snake clone for ya. As a lot of my projects here, there are rip-offs of much more respected and well designed. This project is not different.
A Snake clone made in C++ using the SFML game library. Nothing else in impresive about it.

Either way, clone the repo to check out the source code, or if you want, go to the itch.io link below to download it and play it. Don't worry, it doesn't have a vairus.

Enjoy, and thanks!
